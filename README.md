# Information Encryption Program

## Functional Description
This program is designed to encrypt the contents of a file. Users specify the path to a file, after which the program reads the contents and applies a specified encryption mechanism to encode the data.

## User Interaction
The program supports both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI), providing convenient tools for working with files and encryption.

## Encryption Options
- **Overwrite Existing File:** The program replaces the original file content with its encrypted version.
- **Write to a New File:** The program creates a new file where the encrypted information is stored, leaving the original file untouched.

## Usage Process
- Users select a file to encrypt through a dialog window (in GUI) or by specifying the file path in the command line (CLI).
- Next, users choose the desired option for saving the data: either overwrite the current file or create a new one.
- After the encryption operations are completed, the program informs the user of the successful completion of the process or any errors that occurred.

This program ensures reliable data encryption with a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
